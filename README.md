Power system stabilizer (PSS) optimization using MFO algorithm

The simulation contains an optimization algorithm (Math-Flame Optimazation), which is used to tune diffferent types of PSS that stablizes a Single (synchronous) Machine connected to an Infinite Bus (SMIB). 

The robustness of each controller has been evaluated via four different types of error criteria and coefficients optimized by the MFO which provides reasonable solution. 

Files contain:
1- Seperate optimization for PI + the Excel file of the results I have obtained running the code
2- Seperate optimization for PID + the Excel file of the results I have obtained running the code
3- Seperate optimization for Lead-Lag + the Excel file of the results I have obtained running the code
4- A comparison between all three controllers using the data obtained based on seperate optimization of each

All the best
